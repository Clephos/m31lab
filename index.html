      <h1>About M31Lab</h1>
      <p>
        M31Lab LLC is a Puerto Rican startup founded in 2025, registered in Florida, inspired by the wonder and vast potential of the cosmos. 
        Our name comes from Messier 31, the scientific designation for the Andromeda Galaxyâ€”the nearest spiral galaxy 
        to our own Milky Way and a symbol of exploration, scale, and infinite possibility.
      </p>

        <strong>Kendo Go!</strong> is our first iOS app, designed for absolute beginners interested in the art of kendoâ€”the Japanese way of the sword. 
        Whether you're just getting started or want a quick reference at your side, Kendo Go! makes learning accessible, engaging, and fun.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <p>
        The app includes a comprehensive glossary with kanji, romaji, English, and phonetic pronunciation for essential kendo terms. 
        It also helps users learn to count in Japanese using kanji, romaji, and Arabic numerals. A built-in quiz mode offers 
        interactive learning through randomized questions that test vocabulary and numbers in multiple formats.
