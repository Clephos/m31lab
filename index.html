        Our name comes from Messier 31, the scientific designation for the Andromeda Galaxy—the nearest spiral galaxy 
        to our own Milky Way and a symbol of exploration, scale, and infinite possibility.

        <strong>Pa' Kendo</strong> is our first iOS app, designed for absolute beginners interested in the art of kendo—the Japanese way of the sword. 
        Whether you're just getting started or want a quick reference at your side, Pa' Kendo makes learning accessible, engaging, and fun.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <p>
        The app includes a comprehensive glossary with kanji, romaji, English, and phonetic pronunciation for essential kendo terms. 
        It also helps users learn to count in Japanese using kanji, romaji, and Arabic numerals. A built-in quiz mode offers 
        interactive learning through randomized questions that test vocabulary and numbers in multiple formats.
